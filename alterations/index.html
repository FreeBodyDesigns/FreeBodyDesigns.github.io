<h2>Dress Alterations</h2>
<p>
Do you have an old dress that needs some love? Perhaps some rhinestones are missing (or a lot!), a seam is ripping, the elastic is overstretched, or old feathers are falling off left and right? Some costumes that have been through years of wear and tear might just need need some minor sprucing up so you can look your best on the dance floor. Some costume malfunctions are dangerous -- like ripped trim at the bottom of your skirt that can easily be tripped on -- and must be fixed right away to avoid injury of yourself, your partner, or other dancers around you.
