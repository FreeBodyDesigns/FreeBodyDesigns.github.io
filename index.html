<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Free Body Designs is dedicated to bringing quality swimwear, dancewear, and activewear to bodies of all shapes and sizes.</p>

<h2>Karen | Founder</h2>
<p>Karen has been sewing for nearly a decade and now specializes in dance costumes, which translates very well to swimwear and athleisure. Being a competitive ballroom dancer herself, she has created all of her competition ballroom and Latin costumes over the last 5 years.</p>

<p>After seeing many friends of all sizes upset about the small range of sizes in attractive swimwear and activewear, Karen started to feel an urge to fill that hole in the market. She personally understands the gripes of these people, as she is naturally a very small size and often times her clothing selection in stores is very limited or even nonexistent. While it is a different problem that many plus size women have, Karen empathizes and vows to be as inclusive as possible.</p>

<h2>Sizing</h2>
<p>Free Body Designs carries a large size range from XS to 4X in most ready-to-wear products. However, all bodies are different, and you should celebrate yours! Weâ€™ve got you covered, from big boobs to little boobs or none at all, asymmetrical shoulders and hips, and any other unique features. Whatever your needs are, Free Body Designs is happy to work with you to create something that works with your body. Simply contact <a href="mailto:info@freebodydesigns.com">info@freebodydesigns.com</a> to place your order!</p>
