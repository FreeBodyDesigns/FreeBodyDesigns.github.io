<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Free Body Designs is dedicated to bringing quality swimwear, dancewear, and activewear to bodies of all shapes and sizes.</p>

<h2>Karen | Founder</h2>
<p>Karen has been sewing for nearly a decade and now specializes in dance costumes, which translates very well to swimwear and athleisure. Being a competitive ballroom dancer herself, she has created all of her competition ballroom and Latin costumes over the last 5 years.</p>

<p>After seeing many friends of all sizes upset about the small range of sizes in attractive swimwear and activewear, Karen started to feel an urge to fill that hole in the market. She personally understands the gripes of these people, as she is naturally a very small size and often times her clothing selection in stores is very limited or even nonexistent. While it is a different problem that many plus size women have, Karen empathizes and vows to be as inclusive as possible.</p>

<h2>Sizing</h2>
<p>Free Body Designs carries a large size range from XS to 4X in most ready-to-wear products. However, all bodies are different, and some have different proportions. Free Body Designs is happy to create anything carried in the shop using your provided measurements for a small additional fee. Simply contact info@freebodydesigns to place your order!</p>
